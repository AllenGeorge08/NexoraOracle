# NEXORA ORACLE

## **Nexora Oracle** is an tamper proof oracle which uses the concept of `Exponential Moving Average` combined with the chainlink data feeds to provide a double security layer. 

- It uses chainlink data feeds to pull the latest price feeds out there and then smooths out the price feed to give predictable prices in cases of a price crash.
